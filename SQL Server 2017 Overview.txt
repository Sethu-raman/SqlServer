Everything Build In - Technical Overview

built-in json deserialization?

PolyBase - T-SQL yarn engine to push data 
BLOB storage

PolyBase architecture

Protect your data at rest and in motion
(without impacting database performance)

encrypted column key (Ex: SSN field)

Dynamic Data Masking

role based encryption

Stretch SQL Server into Azure
securely stretch cold tables to Azure with remote query processing
push tables into cloud (helps maintainability and audit history)

stretch database available only in Azure

containerization

temporal tables - change tracking

temporal database support - BETWEEN

Select * from Table 
For SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN @Start and @End
where ID = 1;

FOR JSON

In PATH mode, use the dot syntax - for ex: 'Item.Price'
to format nested output.

use the ROOT option to specify a named root element.

SELECT Number AS [Order.Number], Date as [Order.Date]
	CUSTOMER AS AccountNumber,
	Price AS 'Item.UnitPrice', Quantity AS 'Item.Quantity'
FROM SalesOrder
FOR JSON PATH, ROOT('Orders');

{
	Orders:
	{	
		"Order":{
			"Number":"12345",
			"Date":"2018-02-28"
		},
		"AccountNumber":"AWS1234",
		"Item":{
			"Price":24.99,
			"Quantity":2
		}		
	}
}
